# Kometa-AI Stage 3 Completion Report

## Completed Implementation

Stage 3 of the Kometa-AI project has been successfully completed. This stage focused on implementing the Claude AI integration, which provides the core intelligence for the movie classification system.

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Claude API Client**
   - Full implementation using the anthropic Python SDK
   - Support for both synchronous API calls
   - Robust error handling with exponential backoff retry mechanism
   - JSON response parsing with multiple fallback strategies

2. **Cost Tracking System**
   - Detailed tracking of API usage (input tokens, output tokens)
   - Cost estimation based on current Claude pricing
   - Per-collection and overall usage statistics
   - Support for usage reporting

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Optimized system prompt for consistent movie classification
   - Collection-specific prompt templating
   - Support for confidence thresholds in decision making
   - Enhanced JSON data formatting for movies

4. **Efficient Processing System**
   - Batched processing for large movie libraries
   - Optimal batch size determination (150 movies per batch)
   - Incremental processing to minimize API calls
   - Change detection using metadata hashing

5. **Decision Management**
   - Integration with the state management system
   - Storage of confidence scores and reasoning
   - Support for borderline case explanations
   - Efficient caching to avoid reprocessing unchanged movies

6. **Debug Mode**
   - Optional logging of full prompts and responses
   - Detailed debug information for troubleshooting
   - Performance metrics and batch processing stats

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Synthetic movie data for consistent testing
   - Mock Claude client for test automation
   - End-to-end tests for the entire classification pipeline
   - Specific tests for batching, incremental processing, and multi-collection handling

### Key Features

#### Intelligent Classification

The Claude integration enables sophisticated movie classification based on detailed criteria, going beyond simple metadata matching. The system can understand complex collection definitions and apply them consistently across large movie libraries.

#### Cost Optimization

The implementation focuses heavily on minimizing API costs through:
- Efficient batching to optimize token usage
- Incremental processing to avoid redundant API calls
- Change detection to only reprocess movies with updated metadata
- Borderline confidence tracking to selectively reprocess uncertain cases

#### Reliability

The system includes several reliability features:
- Exponential backoff for API rate limiting
- Multiple JSON parsing strategies for robust response handling
- State persistence with backup and restore functionality
- Detailed error tracking and reporting

### Test Status

All tests for the Claude integration are passing. The test suite covers:
- Prompt formatting
- Claude client functionality
- Movie processor logic
- Batched processing
- Incremental processing
- Cross-collection movie handling

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Claude integration connects seamlessly with the Stage 2 components:
- Uses the tag manager for applying classification results
- Integrates with the state management system for decision persistence
- Works with the existing Radarr client for movie data retrieval
- Maintains the KAI- tag prefix convention

## Next Steps for Stage 4

Stage 4 will focus on implementing the full pipeline with:

1. Scheduling for automatic execution
2. Email notifications for classification results
3. Error handling and reporting
4. Command-line interface enhancements
5. Full end-to-end testing with real APIs

## Known Issues

1. The mock testing framework doesn't simulate token limits realistically
2. Need more comprehensive error handling for malformed collection definitions
3. Further optimization may be possible for very large movie libraries (10,000+ movies)

These issues will be addressed in Stage 4 as we complete the final production-ready implementation.
