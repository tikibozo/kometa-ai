# Kometa-AI Stage 2 Completion Report

## Completed Implementation

Stage 2 of the Kometa-AI project has been successfully completed. This stage focused on completing the Radarr integration with full tag management capabilities and building the foundation for the AI-powered collection management system.

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Enhanced RadarrClient**
   - Added complete movie update functionality
   - Implemented comprehensive tag operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Added methods for tag application and removal
   - Enhanced error handling with proper retry logic

2. **TagManager Class**
   - Created a dedicated module for tag management
   - Implemented KAI- prefix convention for AI-managed tags
   - Added collection name slugification for consistent naming
   - Developed tag caching for performance optimization

3. **Tag Application Logic**
   - Implemented reconciliation logic for collection updates
   - Added support for confidence thresholds
   - Developed efficient change detection to minimize API calls
   - Created helpers for collection membership checking

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
   - Mock RadarrClient for isolated testing
   - High test coverage (97% for new modules)

### Key Features

#### Tag Naming Convention Implementation

The KAI- prefix convention has been fully implemented, allowing Kometa-AI to manage its own tags without interfering with manually created tags. Collection names are properly slugified to create consistent, URL-friendly tag labels.

#### Tag Reconciliation Logic

The reconciliation system allows for bulk updates of movie tags based on AI decisions, with:
- Support for confidence thresholds to avoid borderline decisions
- Efficient change detection to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Tracking of added and removed movies for reporting
- Support for multi-collection membership

#### Metadata Hash Calculation

The system now properly calculates metadata hashes for movies, which will enable efficient change detection in Stage 3 when integrating with Claude.

### Test Status

All 14 unit tests for the TagManager are passing, with 97% code coverage for the new module. The updated Movie model and RadarrClient also have improved test coverage.

## Next Steps for Stage 3

Stage 3 will focus on integrating Claude AI with:

1. Claude API client implementation
2. Prompt formatting and context management
3. Response parsing for classification decisions
4. Metadata-based change detection for efficient reprocessing
5. Rate limiting and batched processing for large libraries

## Known Issues

1. The update_movie method needs to be tested with a real Radarr instance to verify all required fields are included
2. Tag deletion should be used cautiously to avoid removing tags that may be used by other systems
3. The unidecode dependency has been added - this needs to be included in the Docker image
