- System requirement specifications for different library sizes

#### Production Validation Testing

The integration tests validate that the production deployment features are working correctly:
- Container health check verification
- Docker image structure validation
- Environment variable processing
- Volume mounting and permissions
- Container security best practices
- CLI functionality

### Next Steps and Future Enhancements

While Kometa-AI is now production-ready, there are several areas that could be enhanced in future updates:

1. **Web UI for Management**
   - Add a simple web interface for monitoring and configuration
   - Provide visual reports of collection changes
   - Enable collection configuration through the UI

2. **Additional Notification Channels**
   - Support for webhooks integration
   - Support for Slack, Discord, and other messaging platforms
   - Advanced notification customization

3. **Enhanced Scheduling**
   - Support for cron-style expressions
   - Blackout period configuration
   - Collection-specific scheduling

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel processing of collections
   - Memory-mapped storage for large libraries
   - Advanced caching mechanisms

5. **Sonarr Integration**
   - Extend the system to TV shows
   - Support dual Radarr/Sonarr operation
   - Combined movie and TV show collections

## Conclusion

The completion of Stage 6 marks Kometa-AI as production-ready. The system is now properly configured, optimized, documented, and tested for real-world use. Users can deploy Kometa-AI with confidence, following the comprehensive documentation and examples provided.

The Docker-based deployment ensures consistent operation across different environments, while the optimized container provides efficient resource usage. The extensive documentation and examples make it easy for users to get started and customize the system to their specific needs.

With all planned stages now complete, Kometa-AI fulfills its goal of providing an AI-powered bridge between Radarr's tagging system and Kometa's collection management, enabling sophisticated, intelligent movie collections based on natural language prompts rather than just metadata.
