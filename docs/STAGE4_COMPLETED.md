# Kometa-AI Stage 4 Completion Report

## Completed Implementation

Stage 4 of the Kometa-AI project has been successfully completed. This stage focused on implementing the full end-to-end pipeline with scheduling, notifications, and comprehensive error handling to create a production-ready system.

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Scheduling System**
   - Flexible scheduling with support for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals
   - Precise start time configuration for predictable execution
   - Graceful handling of container restarts and termination signals
   - Clean sleep implementation with periodic wake-ups for responsive shutdown

2. **Email Notification System**
   - Robust SMTP email delivery with support for:
     - Plain SMTP, TLS, and SSL connections
     - Authentication (username/password)
     - Multiple recipient addresses
     - Custom sender address and reply-to
   - Customizable notification triggers based on changes and errors
   - Comprehensive email content formatting with Markdown support

3. **Notification Formatting**
   - Detailed processing summaries with:
     - Collection-by-collection breakdown of changes
     - Grouped error reporting by context
     - Processing statistics and token usage
     - Cost estimation
   - Clear error notifications with traceback information
   - Consistent formatting for readability

4. **Full Pipeline Workflow**

   - Command-line interface with support for:
     - Immediate execution (--run-now)
     - Dry run mode (--dry-run)
     - Processing specific collections (--collection)
     - Force refresh of decisions (--force-refresh)
     - Health check (--health-check)
     - Email testing (--send-test-email)
   - Support for both single-run and continuous scheduled execution

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**

     - Improved retry logic with exponential backoff
     - Detailed error categorization and context
     - Fallback strategies for Claude response parsing
     - Specific handling for common API errors
   - Robust state persistence with backup and recovery
   - Graceful degradation under error conditions
   - Detailed error reporting in logs and notifications

6. **Testing Framework**
   - Comprehensive test suite for the entire pipeline:
     - End-to-end pipeline tests
     - Scheduling system tests
     - Email notification tests
     - Error handling tests
   - Mocked service dependencies for reliable testing
   - Test coverage for all new components

### Key Features

#### Intelligent Scheduling

The scheduling system is designed to be flexible and reliable, supporting both interval-based and time-based scheduling. This allows the system to run at specific times (e.g., 3:00 AM daily) or at regular intervals (e.g., every 12 hours). The scheduling system also handles container restarts gracefully, calculating the next run time based on the configured schedule.

#### Rich Email Notifications

The notification system provides detailed information about each processing run, including changes made, errors encountered, and processing statistics. Emails are formatted in Markdown for readability and include:

- Summary statistics (total changes, errors, collections processed)
- Collection-by-collection breakdown of changes (movies added/removed)
- Detailed error reports with context
- Processing statistics (API calls, token usage, cost)
- Next scheduled run time

#### Comprehensive Error Handling

The error handling system has been significantly enhanced to handle a wide range of error conditions, from API timeouts to malformed responses. The system includes:

- Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detailed error categorization for targeted handling
- Fallback strategies for parsing Claude responses
- Automatic backup and recovery of state data
- Comprehensive error reporting in logs and notifications

#### Robust Command-line Interface

The command-line interface provides a comprehensive set of options for controlling the pipeline, including:

- Immediate execution with `--run-now`
- Dry run mode with `--dry-run`
- Processing specific collections with `--collection`
- Force refreshing decisions with `--force-refresh`
- Health checking with `--health-check`
- Testing email configuration with `--send-test-email`

### Test Status

All tests for Stage 4 components are passing, with comprehensive coverage of:

- Scheduling utilities and next run time calculation
- Email notification formatting and delivery
- Full pipeline execution with mock services
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

The testing framework uses a combination of unit tests, mock objects, and patched functions to ensure reliable testing without external dependencies.

## Integration with Previous Stages

Stage 4 integrates seamlessly with the components developed in previous stages:

- **Stage 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: Builds on the Docker environment, configuration system, and CLI foundation.
- **Stage 2 (Radarr Integration)**: Utilizes the tag management system for applying classification decisions.
- **Stage 3 (Claude Integration)**: Leverages the AI classification system with improved error handling and response parsing.

## Deployment Instructions

### Operational Commands

Once deployed, the following commands can be used to interact with the system:

docker logs kometa-ai
```

**Run immediately (outside of schedule):**
```bash
docker exec kometa-ai python -m kometa_ai --run-now
```

**Run a specific collection:**
```bash
docker exec kometa-ai python -m kometa_ai --run-now --collection "Action Movies"
```

**Force refresh all decisions:**
```bash
docker exec kometa-ai python -m kometa_ai --run-now --force-refresh
```

**Check health status:**
```bash
docker exec kometa-ai python -m kometa_ai --health-check
```

**Test email configuration:**
```bash
docker exec kometa-ai python -m kometa_ai --send-test-email
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The scheduling system does not yet support cron-style expressions for more complex scheduling patterns.
2. Email notifications currently use plain text formatting, not HTML, which limits the visual appeal of the notifications.
3. The system requires a restart to apply environment variable changes.
4. There is no web UI for monitoring or configuration; all interaction is through the command line.

## Next Steps for Future Enhancement

1. **Web UI for Monitoring**: A simple web interface to monitor runs, view changes, and configure collections.
2. **Enhanced Claude Response Handling**: Further optimization of prompt design and response parsing for even better classification.
3. **Additional Notification Channels**: Support for webhooks, Slack, Discord, and other notification methods.
4. **Sonarr Integration**: Extend the system to support TV show collections via Sonarr.
5. **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for cron expressions and blackout periods.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimizations for very large movie libraries (10,000+ movies).

## Conclusion

The completion of Stage 4 represents a significant milestone in the Kometa-AI project. The system is now production-ready with comprehensive scheduling, notification, and error handling capabilities. The integration of Claude AI with Radarr provides a powerful tool for creating dynamic, intelligent movie collections in Plex.

The system's architecture allows for easy deployment via Docker, with flexible configuration options through environment variables. The robust command-line interface provides all the necessary tools for managing and monitoring the system.

With the completion of all planned stages, Kometa-AI is now ready for production use. Future enhancements will focus on adding additional features and optimizations rather than core functionality.
