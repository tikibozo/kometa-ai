# Kometa-AI
[![Kometa-AI CI/CD](https://github.com/tikibozo/kometa-ai/actions/workflows/kometa-ci-cd.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/tikibozo/kometa-ai/actions/workflows/kometa-ci-cd.yml)

Kometa-AI integrates Claude AI as a pre-processor of Kometa configurations to intelligently select movies for collections based on natural language prompts.

## Overview

Kometa-AI is a dockerized Python application that:
1. Examines your existing Kometa configuration looking for AI-tagged collections
2. Queries your existing Radarr instance for movies
3. Asks Claude to evaluate if each movie should be in the defined collection based on the provided prompt
4. Updates tags in Radarr accordingly so Kometa can do the actual collection updating in Plex

In short, once you set this up, you can simply add a comment block to an existing Kometa (Radarr) collection, Kometa-AI will pre-process your movies based on the provided prompt, store the results as a tag collection in Radarr, and then the next time Kometa runs it will execute the Radarr tag builder to populate the collection in Plex. 

This project is not associated with Kometa directly, I'm just a fan. This is also explicitly designed to not interfere with Kometa's processing in any way - it just looks at the configuration (which is why our config is in a comment block), and then puts data in Radarr so Kometa can use it.

## But why though? What problem does this solve?
So I started off giving Claude my Radarr db and the kometa community repo, and asked it to come up with ideas for collections (try it! it's fun.) It came up with some really great ideas for collections! However implementing these interesting collections meant figuring out either a metadata scheme (between x release dates from y directors, etc.) or trying to find someone who had already done the work to build the movie list and created an imdb list (or similar.) Some of the collections worked fine this way, but for others I needed a way to have Claude decide which movies should be in the interesting new collection we came up with. 

So that's what this does - give it some interesting collection name/prompt, and it'll figure out which of your movies should be in it. The possibilties are endless!

## This thing costs money, but not like that
While this project is MIT Licensed open source, **THIS APP REQUIRES A CLAUDE/ANTHROPIC API KEY. YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND ACTUAL MONEY IN ORDER TO USE IT.** It won't cost much, and there are features designed to minimize costs. But calling into Claude via programmatic means is not free, and is also separate from the chat subscription. The app will report the acutal costs it incurs (which is usually very little per run) though larger libraries will end up costing additional money for new collections as it needs to evaluate each movie for suitability in the collection which is a "# of movies -> cost" scale point. 

Kometa-AI saves results, so unless you change the collection or movie definition, it won't re-evaluate each movie against each collection on each run. Once the first run of a given collection is completed, it'll just send up new or changed movies for evaluation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Classification**: Leverage Claude AI to intelligently categorize movies based on sophisticated criteria
- **Easy Configuration**: Define collections using natural language prompts via special comment blocks in Kometa YAML files
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for large movie libraries with incremental processing and batching
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Self-managed scheduling based on configurable intervals
- **Email Notifications**: Comprehensive email reports of changes and errors
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory-efficient design for libraries of any size
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Complete Docker-based deployment with security best practices
- **Tag Consistency**: Automatic detection and optional correction of mismatched radarr_taglist values

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: AI collections are defined in standard Kometa YAML files using special comment blocks
2. **Tagging Convention**: All AI-managed tags use the prefix `KAI-` (e.g., `KAI-film-noir`)
3. **Scheduling**: The script manages its own scheduling based on environment variables
4. **Notifications**: Email notifications summarize changes and errors

## Collection Configuration

Extend Kometa's existing collection definition files with special comment blocks placed above the collection name:

```yaml
collections:
  # === KOMETA-AI ===
  # enabled: true
  # confidence_threshold: 0.7
  # prompt: |
  #   Identify film noir movies based on these criteria:
  #   - Made primarily between 1940-1959
  #   - Dark, cynical themes and moral ambiguity
  #   - Visual style emphasizing shadows, unusual angles
  #   - Crime or detective storylines
  #   - Femme fatale character often present
  # === END KOMETA-AI ===
  Film Noir:
    radarr_taglist: KAI-film-noir
    # ... existing Kometa config ...
```

Many example collections are provided in the `config-examples` directory.
