# State Module Import Fix

This document describes the fixes implemented for the state module import issues in CI environments.

## Problem Description

The `kometa_ai.state` module was not properly importable in CI environments, causing the following issues:

1. Type checking with mypy was failing due to missing imports
2. CI tests were failing because the state module couldn't be found
3. Fallback code in `__main__.py` was being used, which provided mocked functionality

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the import issues was determined to be:

1. Incorrect packaging configuration: The state module wasn't properly included in the distribution
2. Missing py.typed files: Type checking markers were absent
3. Site-packages installation issues: The files weren't correctly copied to site-packages

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Package Structure Fixes

- Added `py.typed` files to all subpackages to support type checking
- Updated `setup.py` to explicitly include all necessary packages
- Made the package installation extract all files by setting `zip_safe=False`
- Added package data entries for all subpackages

```python
setup(
    # ...
    packages=['kometa_ai', 
             'kometa_ai.claude', 
             'kometa_ai.common', 
             'kometa_ai.kometa', 
             'kometa_ai.notification', 
             'kometa_ai.radarr', 
             'kometa_ai.state',
             'kometa_ai.utils'],
    package_data={
        'kometa_ai': ['py.typed'],
        'kometa_ai.state': ['py.typed', '*.py'],
        'kometa_ai.claude': ['py.typed', '*.py'],
        # ...
    },
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

### 2. CI Environment Fixes

- Created a dedicated fix script (`ci_fix_state_module.py`) that ensures:
  - All subpackages exist in site-packages
  - All necessary Python files are copied correctly
  - `py.typed` markers exist for type checking
  - Module imports are verified after fixing

- Updated `run_ci_tests.sh` with an improved fix for the state directory issue
- Added support for the fix script to the GitHub Actions workflow

### 3. Type Checking Configurations

- Created a more comprehensive `mypy.ini` with proper module configurations
- Added explicit package bases to support proper import resolution
- Configured mypy to handle the state module correctly

```ini
[mypy]
# Global options
# ...
namespace_packages = False
explicit_package_bases = True

# Package-specific settings
[mypy.kometa_ai]
ignore_missing_imports = False
disallow_untyped_defs = False
check_untyped_defs = True

[mypy.kometa_ai.state]
ignore_missing_imports = False
implicit_reexport = True
# ...
```

### 4. Additional Safeguards

- Added a MANIFEST.in file to ensure all package files are included in distributions
- Created diagnostic scripts (`test_imports.py`) to identify and debug import issues
- Added GitHub Actions workflow to catch issues early

## Validation

The fix was validated by:

1. Running the `ci_fix_state_module.py` script, which successfully restored module imports
2. Using the `test_imports.py` script to verify imports work after the fixes
3. Confirming that the state module can be imported directly without relying on fallback code

All core state module components (StateManager and DecisionRecord) are now properly importable in both development and CI environments.

## Future Recommendations

1. Run the diagnostic scripts in CI environments to catch import issues early
2. Use explicit package declarations instead of `find_packages()` for better control
3. Include `py.typed` files in all modules that should support type checking
4. Keep the MANIFEST.in file updated when adding new modules or package data
