While I shaped and directed it, Claude wrote all the code in this repo. It likes to document things periodically and that's also how I got this project going, by talking to it for a couple days to plan out the implementation. (Those are the Stage 1-6 docs.) 

This folder is a place to store those and docs from other random efforts that it either decided to document or that I asked it for.
