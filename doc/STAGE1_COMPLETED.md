# Kometa-AI Stage 1 Completion Report

## Completed Implementation

The Stage 1 implementation of Kometa-AI has been successfully completed. This stage focused on setting up the core infrastructure and Docker environment for the project.

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Project Structure and Organization**
   - Created the Python package structure with appropriate modules
   - Set up Docker configuration with both production and development Dockerfiles
   - Implemented clean separation of concerns with models, parsers, clients, and utilities

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variables for all settings with validation
   - Support for booleans, integers, lists, and strings
   - Default values for optional configurations

3. **Command-line Interface**
   - Implemented all specified CLI options (--run-now, --dry-run, etc.)
   - Health check functionality to verify connectivity
   - Configuration dump utility

4. **Logging System**
   - JSON-formatted structured logging
   - Log rotation and organization
   - Debug and normal logging modes

5. **Radarr API Client (Read-only)**
   - Authentication using API key header
   - Automated retry with exponential backoff
   - Methods for fetching movies and tags
   - Data models for movies and tags

6. **Kometa Configuration Parser**
   - YAML parsing with special comment block extraction
   - Support for all configuration parameters
   - Manual key-value parsing for robustness

7. **State Management**
   - JSON-based state persistence
   - Backup and restore functionality
   - Decision records for tracking AI choices

8. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for all core components
   - Mock data for testing
   - Helper scripts for development

### Execution Scripts

To facilitate development and testing, the following scripts have been created:

- `run_local.sh`: Runs the application locally using a Python virtual environment
- `run_tests.sh`: Runs the unit tests in a clean environment
- `docker_dev.sh`: Builds and runs the development Docker container

### Test Status

All 16 unit tests are passing, covering:
- Configuration management
- Kometa parser functionality
- State management

Current test coverage is:
- Overall: 35%
- Config module: 85%
- Kometa parser: 90%
- State manager: 68% 

## Next Steps for Stage 2

Stage 2 will focus on completing the Radarr integration with:

1. Full tag management (create, update, delete)
2. Enhanced movie metadata retrieval
3. Tag application logic
4. Change detection using metadata hash
5. Integration tests with a real Radarr instance

## Known Issues

1. Docker build has some permission issues with the ._git files on macOS
2. Docker tests need a mock Radarr server for proper integration testing
3. Need more testing of the CLI options

These issues will be addressed in Stage 2 as we continue development.
